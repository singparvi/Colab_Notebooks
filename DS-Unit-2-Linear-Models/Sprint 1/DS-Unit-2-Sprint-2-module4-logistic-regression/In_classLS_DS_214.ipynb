For those who are new to Kaggle, it is a platform that hosts machine learning competitions. Kaggle typically breaks the data into two sets you can download:\n",">\n","> 1. a **training set**, which includes the _independent variables,_ as well as the _dependent variable_ (what you are trying to predict).\n",">\n","> 2. a **test set**, which just has the _independent variables._ You will make predictions for the test set, which you can submit to Kaggle and get back a score of how well you did.\n",">\n","> This is the basic idea needed to get started with machine learning, but to do well, there is a bit more complexity to understand. **You will want to create your own training and validation sets (by splitting the Kaggle “training” data). You will just use your smaller training set (a subset of Kaggle’s training data) for building your model, and you can evaluate it on your validation set (also a subset of Kaggle’s training data) before you submit to Kaggle.**\n",">\n","> The most important reason for this is that Kaggle has split the test data into two sets: for the public and private leaderboards. The score you see on the public leaderboard is just for a subset of your predictions (and you don’t know which subset!). How your predictions fare on the private leaderboard won’t be revealed until the end of the competition. The reason this is important is that you could end up overfitting to the public leaderboard and you wouldn’t realize it until the very end when you did poorly on the private leaderboard. Using a good validation set can prevent this. You can check if your validation set is any good by seeing if your model has similar scores on it to compared with on the Kaggle test set. ...\n",">\n","> Understanding these distinctions is not just useful for Kaggle. In any predictive machine learning project, you want your model to be able to perform well on new data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PcQyJk61yDlh"},"source":["### 2-way train/test split is not enough\n","\n","#### Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), Chapter 7: Model Assessment and Selection\n","\n","> If we are in a data-rich situation, the best approach is to randomly divide the dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to fit the models; the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection; the test set is used for assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model. Ideally, the test set should be kept in a \"vault,\" and be brought out only at the end of the data analysis. Suppose instead that we use the test-set repeatedly, choosing the model with the smallest test-set error. Then the test set error of the final chosen model will underestimate the true test error, sometimes substantially.\n","\n","#### Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido, [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://books.google.com/books?id=1-4lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA270)\n","\n","> The distinction between the training set, validation set, and test set is fundamentally important to applying machine learning methods in practice. Any choices made based on the test set accuracy \"leak\" information from the test set into the model. Therefore, it is important to keep a separate test set, which is only used for the final evaluation. It is good practice to do all exploratory analysis and model selection using the combination of a training and a validation set, and reserve the test set for a final evaluation - this is even true for exploratory visualization. Strictly speaking, evaluating more than one model on the test set and choosing the better of the two will result in an overly optimistic estimate of how accurate the model is.\n","\n","#### Hadley Wickham, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html#hypothesis-generation-vs.hypothesis-confirmation)\n","\n","> There is a pair of ideas that you must understand in order to do inference correctly:\n",">\n","> 1.

You can use an observation as many times as you like for exploration, but you can only use it once for confirmation. As soon as you use an observation twice, you’ve switched from confirmation to exploration.\n",">\n","> This is necessary because to confirm a hypothesis you must use data independent of the data that you used to generate the hypothesis. Otherwise you will be over optimistic.

This may seem like advice so obvious it can be passed over quickly, but it is worth spending an extra moment here. There are many cases where smart, analytical people have been tripped up in skipping over this basic comparison. For example, an analyst may see a classification accuracy of 94% from her classifier and conclude that it is doing fairly well—when in fact only 6% of the instances are positive.

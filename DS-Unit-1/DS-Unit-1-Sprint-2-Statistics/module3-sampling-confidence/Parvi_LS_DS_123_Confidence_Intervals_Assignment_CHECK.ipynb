For example, a 12-oz serving of Coke has 34mg of caffeine, and a 12-oz serving of Pepsi has 37.6mg of caffeine. However, fountain soft drinks are typically mixed in individual restaurant dispensers, so it is more difficult to maintain a standard level of caffeine per serving. In this study, researchers randomly sampled Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, and Diet Pepsi at a set of franchise restaurants and measured the caffeine content in 12oz of each soft drink. The data is found in the Soda.xlsx dataset.\n","\n","Because individuals can be sensitive to caffeine – and because the manufacturers are interested in product consistency – we wish to estimate the mean caffeine content in 12oz of Coke served in franchise restaurants using a 95% confidence interval. \n","\n","You can find the Coke data here: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chelsea-Myers/Lambda-Intro/master/Coke.csv'\n","\n","The first variable is the sample ID and the second variable is the caffeine content in the 12-oz sample measured in mg.\n","\n","Source: A.N.

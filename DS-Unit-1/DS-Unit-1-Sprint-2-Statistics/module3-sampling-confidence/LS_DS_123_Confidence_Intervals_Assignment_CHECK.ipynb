        "Soft drinks like Coke and Pepsi are manufactured to have a standard caffeine content. For example, a 12-oz serving of Coke has 34mg of caffeine, and a 12-oz serving of Pepsi has 37.6mg of caffeine. However, fountain soft drinks are typically mixed in individual restaurant dispensers, so it is more difficult to maintain a standard level of caffeine per serving. In this study, researchers randomly sampled Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, and Diet Pepsi at a set of franchise restaurants and measured the caffeine content in 12oz of each soft drink. The data is found in the Soda.xlsx dataset.\n",

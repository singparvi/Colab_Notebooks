Since it's inception NICS has provided approximately 300 million checks and led to 1.5 million denials. NICS reports the data for each state on a monthly basis in a pdf format. Buzzfeednews.com maintain a csv format of the data from FBI in a csv format which was of great help in the data analysis.<sup>3</sup>\n","\n","In addition to the NICS database the US population information of each state was also imported to normalize the gun sales data using population.
